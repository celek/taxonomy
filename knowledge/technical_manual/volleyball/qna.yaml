    The free playing space is the space above the playing area which is free 
    from any obstructions. The free playing space shall measure a minimum 
    of 7 meters in height from the playing surface. 
  question: What are the dimensions of the court of a volleyball game?
- answer: All lines are 5 centimeters wide. They must be of a light colour which is different
    from the colour of the "oor and from any other lines.
    Boundary lines are Two side lines and two end lines mark the playing court. Both side lines
    and end lines are drawn inside the dimensions of the playing court.

    courts measuring 9 by 9 meters each; however the entire width of the line is
    considered to belong to both courts equally. This line extends beneath
    the net from side line to side line.  
    On each court, an attack line, whose rear edge is drawn 3 meters back from
    the axis of the centre line, marks the front zone.
  question: What are the different lines on a volleyball court ?
- answer: Front zone On each court the front zone is limited by the axis of the centre line and 
    the rear edge of the attack line. The front zone is considered to extend beyond the side lines 
    to the end of the free zone. Service zone The service zone is a 9#m wide area behind each end line. 
    It is laterally limited by two short lines, each 15#cm long, drawn 20#cm behind the end line 
    as an extension of the side lines. Both short lines are included in the width of the service 
    zone. In depth, the service zone extends to the end of the free zone.
  question: What are the different zones on a volleyball court?
- answer: Placed vertically over the centre line there is a net whose top is set at the
    height of 2.43 meters for men and 2.24 meters for women.
    Its height is measured from the centre of the playing court. The net
    height (over the two side lines) must be exactly the same and must not
    exceed the official height by more than 2 cm. 
  question:  what is the heigh of the net in volleyball ?

    of fiberglass or similar material.
    An antenna is fastened at the outer edge of each side band. The
    antennae are placed on opposite sides of the net.
    The top 80 cm of each antenna extends above the net and is marked
    with 10 cm stripes of contrasting colour, preferably red and white.
    The antennae are considered as part of the net and laterally delimit the
    crossing space.
  question: what arethe dimentions and locations of the 2 antennaes on a volleyball net ?
