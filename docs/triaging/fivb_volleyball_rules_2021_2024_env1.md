| | Volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. There are different versions available for speci!c circumstances in order to |
| --- |
| offer the versatility of the game to everyone. | +++++++ + + + + + + + + + + + The object of the game is to send the ball over the net in order to ground it on the opponent’s court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent. The |
| team has three hits for returning the ball (in addition to the block contact). +++++++ + + + | + + The ball is put in play with a service: hit by the server over the net to the + opponents. The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court, goes “out” or a team fails to return it properly. In Volleyball, the team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. |

PART 1: PHILOSOPHY OF RULES AND REFEREEING 

By every measure, Volleyball is one of the world’s top sports – it has more af!liated federations, 

larger TV viewing !gures, larger followers at social media, greater numbers of registered and 

recreational players, than almost any other sport, and an image which is dynamic, clean and 

colorful, combining highly competitive sport and high-level show. 

|

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | PASSING |
|  |  |  | Explosive |
| Jumping Power |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | Action |
| Attack | TEAM GAME | DIVIDED COURTS | Defense |










William Morgan, the game’s creator, would still recognize it because Volleyball has retained certain 

distinctive and essential elements over the years. Some of these it shares with other net/ball/ 

racquet games: – Service – Rotation (taking turns to serve) – Attack – Defense – players able to play 

at the net and in the back of the court. But the sport has moved on. It is explosive, it is spectacular, 

it is fast and free "owing, it has athletic players doing sensational things on court in crowed venues. 

Additionally, Volleyball is unique amongst net games in insisting that the ball is in constant "ight 

– a "ying ball – and by allowing each team a degree of internal passing before the ball must be 

returned to the opponents, creating a kind sharing of the ball to produce equal opportunities for 

scoring points. 

In recent years the FIVB has made great strides in adapting the game to a modern audience, 

liberalising the criteria for ball handling, introducing up to two specialist defensive “Libero” players, 

introducing the technology with the Video Challenge System providing fairness to the effort of the 

athletes and encouraging policies which promote "owing play to entertain the public, both at 

venue and on the screen. 

This text is aimed at a broad Volleyball public – players, coaches, referees, spectators, commentators, 

and others – because an understanding of the rules allows better play and personal satisfaction – 

coaches can create better team structure and tactics, giving players full rein to display their skills, 

and an understanding of the relationship between written rules and actual actions on the court 

allows of!cials to make better decisions. 

Volleyball is both recreational and competitive. Recreational sport taps into the human spirit and 

promotes “fun” and healthy life. Competition allows people to exhibit the best of ability, creativity, 

freedom of expression and !ghting spirit. The rules are designed and structured to allow all of 

these facets to "ourish. 

9OFFICIAL VOLLEYBALL RULES 2021-2024 



| The essence of a good referee lies in the concepts of fairness justice and consistency (being |
| --- |
| positioned in the middle of both playing courts is a symbol of balance). Together these allow |
| the players to trust the referee’s actions. However, the referee must be a facilitator rather than |
| a controller, an orchestra director rather than a dictator, an ef!cient promoter rather than an |
| “ef!cient” punisher. |
| By understanding the reason why a rule has been written and by being clear about its purpose |
| within the framework of the “show”, the referee becomes a big part of the overall successful |
| production, while remaining largely in the background and intervening only when necessary. We |
| can say that a good referee will use the rules to make the competition a ful!lling experience for |
| all concerned. |
| To those who have read thus far, view the rules which follow as the current state of development of |
| a great game, but keep in mind why these preceding few paragraphs may be of equal importance |
| to you in your own position within the sport. |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | on each side of the side bands), made of 10#cm square black mesh. **For FIVB, World and Of!cial Competitions, in conjunction with** **speci!c competition regulations, the mesh may be modi!ed to** **facilitate advertising according to marketing agreements.** |  |
|  | **For FIVB, World and Of!cial Competitions, in conjunction with** **speci!c competition regulations, the mesh may be modi!ed to** **facilitate advertising according to marketing agreements.** |  |
|  | At its top a horizontal band, 7#cm wide, made of two-fold white canvas, is sewn along its full length. Each extreme end of the band has a hole, |  |
|  | through which passes a cord, fastening the band to the posts for |  |
|  | keeping its top taut. |  |
|  | Within the band, a "exible cable fastens the net to the posts and keeps |  |
|  | its top taut. |  |
|  | At the bottom of the net there is another horizontal band, 5cm wide, |  |
|  | similar to the top band, through which is threaded a rope. This rope |  |
|  | fastens the net to the posts and keeps its lower part taut. |  |
|  | Two white bands are fastened vertically to the net and placed directly |  |
| 1.3.2, D3 |
|  | above each side line. |  |
|  | They are 5#cm wide and 1#m long and are considered as part of the net. |  |
|  | An antenna is a "exible rod, 1.80#m long and 10#mm in diameter, made of !berglass or similar material. |  |
|  | An antenna is fastened at the outer edge of each side band. The antennae are placed on opposite sides of the net. | 2.3, D3 |
|  | The top 80#cm of each antenna extends above the net and is marked with 10#cm stripes of contrasting colour, preferably red and white. |  |

The team's starting line-up indicates the rotational order of the players on the court. This order must be maintained throughout the set. Before the start of each set, the coach has to present the starting line-up of his/her team on a line-up sheet or via the electronic device, if used. The sheet is submitted, duly !lled in and signed, to the 2nd referee or the scorer – or electronically sent directly to the e-scorer. The players who are not in the starting line-up of a set are the substitutes for that set (except the Liberos). Once the line-up sheet has been delivered to the 2nd referee or scorer, no change in the line-up may be authorized without a regular substitution. Discrepancies between players’ position on court and on the line-up sheet are dealt with as follows: when such a discrepancy is discovered before the start of the set, players' positions must be recti!ed according to those on the line-up sheet – there will be no sanction; when, before the start of the set, any player on court is found not to be registered on the line-up sheet of that set, this player must be changed to conform to the line-up sheet – there will be no sanction; however, if the coach wishes to keep such non-recorded player(s) on the court, he/she has to request regular substitution(s), by use of the corresponding hand signal, which will then be recorded on the score sheet. If a discrepancy between players’ positions and the line-up sheet is discovered later, the team at fault must revert to the correct positions. The opponent’s points remain valid and in addition they receive a point and the next service. All points scored by the team at fault from the exact moment of the fault up to the discovery of the fault are cancelled. Where a player is found to be on court but he/she is not registered on the team roster, the opponent’s points remain valid, and in addition they gain a point and service. The team at fault will lose all points and/ or sets (0:25, if necessary) gained from the moment the non- registered player entered the court, and will have to submit a revised line-up sheet and send a new registered player into the court, in the position of the non-registered player. | 6.4.3 |

each other and from the rest of the team. 

The Libero uniforms must be numbered like the rest of the team.

The ball may be freely attacked if the Libero makes the same action from outside his/her front zone. | 1.4.1, 13.3.6, 23.3.2.3d, e, D1b |
| 19.3.2 | Libero Replacements |  |
| 19.3.2.1 | Libero Replacements are not counted as substitutions. They are unlimited but there must be a completed rally between two Libero replacements (unless a penalty causes the team to rotate and | 6.1.3, 15.5 |
|  | the Libero to move to position four, or the Acting Libero becomes unable to play, making the rally incomplete.) |  |
| 19.3.2.2 | The regular replacement player may replace and be replaced by either Libero. The Acting Libero can only be replaced by the regular replacement player for that position or by the second Libero. |  |
| 19.3.2.3 | At the start of each set, the Libero cannot enter the court until the 2nd referee has checked the line-up and authorised a Libero replacement with a starting player. | 7.3.2, 12.1 |

| 19.3.2.6 | Subsequent late Libero replacements shall result in the play being interrupted immediately, and the imposition of a delay sanction. The team to serve next will be determined by the level of the delay sanction. | 16.2, D9 |
| 19.3.2.7 | The Libero and the replacing player may only enter or leave the court through the Libero Replacement Zone. | 1.4.4, D1b |
| 19.3.2.8 | Libero replacements must be recorded in the Libero Control Sheet (if one is used) or on the electronic score sheet. | 28.2.2.1, 28.2.2.2 |

| 15.9 |
|  | An illegal Libero replacement should be considered in the same way as an illegal substitution: | 15.9 |
|  | i.e. should the illegal Libero replacement be noticed before the start of the next rally, then this is corrected by the referees, and the team is sanctioned for delay; | D9 |

should the illegal Libero replacement be noticed after the service hit, 

the consequences are the same as for an illegal substitution.

However, a Libero who is the subject of a re-designation may not play for the remainder of the match. If the Libero is not on court when declared unable to play, he/she may also be the subject of a re-designation. The Libero declared unable to play may not play for the remainder of the match. 19.4.2.3 The coach, PSBTTJTUBOUDPBDIor game captain if no coach is present, contacts the secondSeferee informing him/her aboutSFdesignation. 19.4.2.4 Should a re-designated Libero become or be declared unable to play, further re-designations are permitted. 19.4.2.5 If the coach requests the team captain to be re-designated as the new Libero, this will be permitted. 19.4.2.6 In the case of a re-designated Libero, the number of the player re- designated as Libero must be recorded on the score sheet remarks section and on the Libero control sheet (or electronic score sheet if one is used.) 19.4.3 Team with two Liberos 19.4.3.1 Where a team has registered on the score sheet two Liberos, but one becomes unable to play the team has the right to play with only one Libero.

PARTICIPANTS’ CONDUCT

#### See Rules



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20.1.1 | Participants must know the “Of!cial Volleyball Rules” and abide by them. |
| 20.1.2 | Participants must accept referees' decisions with sportsmanlike conduct, without disputing them. In case of doubt, clari!cation may be requested only through the game captain. | 5.1.2.1 |

| 20.2.2 | Communication between team members during the match is permitted. | 5.2.3.4 |






















Minor misconduct offences are not subject to sanctions. It is the

1st referee’s duty to prevent the teams from approaching the sanctioning 

level. 

5.1.2, 21.3 

This is done in two stages: 

Stage 1: by issuing a verbal warning through the game captain; 

Stage 2: by use of a YELLOW CARD to the team member(s) concerned. 

This formal warning is not in itself a sanction but a symbol that the team 

member (and by extension the team) has reached the sanctioning level 

for the match. It is recorded in the score sheet but has no immediate 

consequences.

PART 3: DEFINITIONS 

The Competition/ Control Area is a corridor around the playing court and free zone, which includes 

all spaces up to the outer barriers or delimitation fence. See diagram/!g 1a. 

These are sections within the playing area (i.e. playing court and free zone) as de!ned for a speci!c 

purpose (or with special restrictions) within the rule text. These include: Front Zone, Service Zone, 

Substitution Zone, Free Zone, Back Zone, and Libero Replacement Zone. 

These are sections of the "oor OUTSIDE the free zone, identi!ed by the rules as having a speci!c 

function. These include: warm-up area. 

This is the space de!ned at its upper part by the bottom of the net and the cord joining it to the 

posts, at the sides by the posts, and the bottom by the playing surface. 

The crossing space is de!ned by: 

 – The horizontal band at the top of the net 

 – The antennae and their extension 

 – The ceiling 

The ball must cross to the opponent’s COURT through the crossing space. 

The external space is in the vertical plane of the net outside of the crossing and lower spaces. 

This is the part of the free zone through which substitutions are carried out. 

This statement recognizes that while there are regulations on the standards and speci!cation of 

equipment and facilities, there are occasions when special arrangements can be made by FIVB in 

order to promote the game of Volleyball or to test new conditions. 

The technical speci!cations or limits as de!ned by FIVB to the manufacturers of equipment. 

a) A playing action contrary to the rules. 

b) A rule violation other than a playing action. 



| Dribbling means bouncing the ball (usually as a preparation to tossing and serving). Other |
| --- |
| preparatory actions could include (amongst others) moving the ball from hand to hand. |







83OFFICIAL VOLLEYBALL RULES 2021-2024 

These are personnel whose job it is to maintain the "ow of the game by rolling the ball to the 

server between rallies. 

Quick moppers: are personnel whose job it is to keep the "oor clean and dry if necessary, after each 

rally using small towels. 

This is the system of scoring a point whenever a rally is won. 

The time between sets. The change of courts in the 5th (deciding) set is not to be regarded as an interval. 

This is the act by which a Libero, who cannot continue or is declared by the team “unable to play”, 

has his/her role taken by any other player (except the regular replacement player) not on the court 

at the moment of the re-designation. 



| This is the act by which a regular player leaves the court and either Libero (if more than one) takes |
| --- |
| his/her place. This can even include Libero for Libero exchanges. The regular player can then replace |
| either Libero. There must be a completed rally between replacements involving any Libero. |










Any action which will create an advantage against the opponent team or any action which prevents 

an opponent from playing the ball. 

An FIVB of!cial form which registers players and team of!cials. It should be presented during the 

Preliminary Inquiry. 

An object or a person which while outside the playing court or close to the limit of the free playing 

space provides an obstruction to the "ight of the ball. For example: overhead lights, the referee’s 

chair, TV equipment, scorer’s table, and net posts. Outside objects do not include the antennae 

since they are considered as the part of the net. 

This is the act by which one regular player leaves the court and another regular player takes his/her place. 

There are four cases, when the playing action is considered !rst hit of the team: 

 – service reception 

 – receiving an attack of the opponent team 

 – playing the ball rebounding from own block 

 – playing the ball rebounding from opponent’s block 

The series of events before the start of the match, including the toss, the warming-up session, 

presentation of the teams and referees described in the Speci!c Competition Handbook.
